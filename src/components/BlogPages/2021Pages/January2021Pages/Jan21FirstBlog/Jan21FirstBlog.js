            Water goes everywhere in a modern home and wherever water goes, the
            possibility for water damage follows. This would not be a big
            problem if water damage meant only spills and leaks that are easy to
            detect. But water damage is a huge problem because of how sneaky and
            costly the issue can be. The worst kinds of water damage start deep
            inside the walls of a home and homeowners are usually not aware of
            it until the issue becomes a major problem.

          <p>
            But part of the problem is also the current DIY culture which leads
            homeowners to believe that solving plumbing problems is a matter of
            knowing how to buy and install the right parts. Most DIY plumbing
            videos on YouTube don’t tell homeowners how complicated plumbing
            systems actually are. They mainly focus on how to solve the
            immediate problem, leaving the root cause of the problem
            unaddressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what is the result of such an approach? The problem is solved on
            a cosmetic level, while the real issue is left unattended and also
            given time to fester. Meanwhile, the homeowner goes to sleep with
            the feeling of triumph and a false sense of security. Inevitably,
            the blooming issue manifests as water damage in another part of the
            home or the original problem reoccurs, but this time it is worse and
            costs a lot more to fix, warns{" "}

            The average 2000 sq.ft. home has hundreds of feet of pipes running
            through it. Depending on the number of bathrooms, water-using
            appliances, and floors in the home, this could be anywhere from 100
            to 500 feet or more. The total length of piping in a home is further
            complicated by the type of plumbing layout used during the home’s
            construction. And the pipes may be plastic, copper, water, drain, or
            vent pipes.
            <br />
            The point is a home’s plumbing is incredibly complicated. The
            homeowner’s approach to maintaining these networks of pipes,
            fixtures, and appliances should take that complexity into full
            account. In order to get the complete use of their plumbing,
            minimize problems and solve issues without the risk of reoccurrence,
            homeowners need a professional plumber. A professional plumber is an
            ally who can help homeowners cut down on their plumbing costs in the
            long-run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the reasons why a professional plumber is an investment and
            not an expense.

          </p>
          <h4>1. Detailed diagnosis</h4>
          <p>
            Professional plumbers take a holistic view to problems. They will
            trace a plumbing problem to its origin. And while solving immediate
            problems, they also look out for signs of impending problems and
            help homeowners avoid them. While DIYers focus on putting out fires
            (repair and replacement), professional plumbers focus on preventing
            problems.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Efficient services</h4>
          <p>
            <img
              width={15}
              title="Click and drag to move"

              src={jan21FirstFiveImg}
            />
            ​One of the problems homeowners face when they don’t use
            professional plumbers is that issues are often compounded. Attempts
            to solve problems in one area create problems in other areas.
            Professional plumbers are well trained and they understand how the
            elements of a home’s plumbing systems are interconnected. There
            ensure that the entire plumbing system is working efficiently.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Up-to-date training and equipment</h4>
          <p>
            Professional plumbers like the guys at{" "}
            <Link to="/">Watermen Plumbing</Link> have a
            responsibility, as mandated by their professional codes of conduct,
            to constantly update their operations to the latest industry
            standards. They are continually undergoing training and upgrading
            their equipment to keep pace with new technology and changes in the
            building code. They will in turn transfer these benefits to the
            home’s plumbing to ensure that all its components stay up to date.

          <h4>4. Years of experience</h4>
          <p>
            Solving plumbing problems efficiently requires practical experience.
            There are things that can only be learned by doing. And professional
            plumbers have garnered experience through dealing with a plethora of
            plumbing problems and finding different ways to solve them. This is
            why homeowners can be sure that when they hire a professional
            plumber, that person will always find a way to solve their problems.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Cost-saving</h4>
          <p />
          <p>
            Recognized plumbing professionals like{" "}
            <Link to="/about-us">Watermen Plumbing</Link> work
            with the objective of building relationships. That is why they have
            a perspective that focuses on long-term cost savings for their
            customers, rather than trying to scam homeowners of a few hundred
            dollars. They recognize that the future of their business depends on
            how much they help their customers save money.
          </p>
          <h4>6. ​Improved home value</h4>
          <p>
            ​A professional plumber can help homeowners preserve and improve the
            value of their home. They do this by protecting the features of the
            home from water damage. They also introduce the homeowner to{" "}

            and make the home more enjoyable for its occupants.

            />
          </p>
          <h4>​7. Guarantee of work​</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most important benefits of using a company like Watermen
            Plumbing is that they give homeowners{" "}
            <Link to="/reviews">
              a guarantee of their work
            </Link>
            . Homeowners who take a DIY approach to plumbing issues must spend
            twice to solve a problem if the first attempt fails. But with a
            professional plumber, if problems develop with a job, the plumber
            will fix it at no cost to the homeowner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, dear homeowner, the next time you are tempted to fix a
            broken pipe by yourself, resist that urge and call a professional
            plumber. You will be glad you did!
