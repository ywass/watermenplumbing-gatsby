            Caring for your home’s plumbing system can seem daunting. Your
            plumbing is the workhorse of all the systems in your house. It
            brings clean water and removes unsanitary waste away from your home.
            When the same system is responsible for two such essential tasks,
            it’s even more important to ensure your plumbing is up to the task
            of this critical responsibility. Indoor plumbing can be tricky and
            lead to a myriad of messy problems if it’s not maintained. Here are
            5 tips to keep your plumbing system running smoothly!
          </p>
          <h2>5 Tips for Taking Care of Your Plumbing System</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Keep Your Drain Clean: </b>Clean drains are the healthy bones
              of a well-maintained plumbing system. The first step to ensuring
              your drains remain clean is to refrain from sending harmful items
              into your pipes. You can place drain traps in your sinks to
              prevent foreign objects and destructive items from clogging your
              system. Once your drain is backed up, it can lead to many
              unfortunate plumbing events.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Avoid Hard Water Buildup: </b>Hard water is an enemy to healthy
              pipes. If you aren’t familiar with the term hard water, it’s water
              with high mineral carriers. When water has a high mineral load, it
              can be damaging to water-centric appliances and plumbing fixtures.
              Hard water leaves behind a residue that is damaging to these items
              over time. Avoiding hard water requires installing a water
              softening device that can clear these minerals from your supply.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Monitor Your System for Leaks: </b>Plumbing leaks are
              insidious. They can hide for months without being detected, and
              when you finally find the leak, there’s been significant damage to
              your home. You can avoid this catastrophe by doing periodic system
              checks to look for vulnerable points in your system. Leaks can
              hide, but if you know what to look for, you can spot them fairly
              easily. Look for brown or yellow spots on drywall around your
              house. You can also search areas near your plumbing system for
              signs of mildew or mold, which both have unique odors that you
              can’t miss.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Preventative Not Reactive Maintenance: </b>It’s easy to forget
              about your plumbing until there’s a problem, but it’s better for
              your plumbing if you schedule regular maintenance to keep your
              system in good shape. Drain cleaning, water heater flushing, and
              pipe checks by a professional are just a few of the scheduled
              maintenance services you can arrange with your plumber that can go
              a long way towards keeping your system operating without
              interruptions. Don’t wait for problems to perform plumbing
              maintenance.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Look for Warning Signs: </b>Leaks, high water bills, and slow
              draining are just a few of the signs your plumbing system will
              give you to show it’s in distress. Don’t dismiss these signs as
              inconveniences. When you notice a sink or tub is draining slowly,
              investigate. If your water bill is higher than your typical season
              average, then you should investigate the issue. The key to saving
              your plumbing system and avoiding large-scale plumbing problems is
              to notice the signs your system is having problems and act
              immediately. Any of these signs mentioned above could be an
              indicator of anything from a small leak to a running toilet. You
              can save a lot of headaches and future problems by investigating
              issues early on and solving them.
