            If you own a home with a septic tank or are thinking about buying
            one, it’s important to understand how this system functions on your
            property. What the pros and cons of having a septic tank are, where
            in South Florida you might have one, and what buyers should know
            about septic tanks before purchasing a home with one.
          </p>
          <h2>What Is a Septic Tank?</h2>
          <p>
            A septic tank is a watertight container buried somewhere beneath
            your property. Typically made from, concrete, fiberglass, or
            polyethylene, this tank’s job is to hold wastewater and waste that
            comes from your home. If it goes down a drain, it enters your septic
            tank – everything from your kitchen sink to your showers and
            toilets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once wastewater enters the septic tank, solids separate to form
            sludge at the bottom while oil and grease separate and float to the
            top as scum. Wastewater itself is released into the drain field,
            where it gets purified by the soil before reaching the water table.
            Some of the sludge in the tank will decompose over time but pumping
            sludge and scum every 2-5 years is necessary for maintaining a
            well-functioning septic system.

          <h3>What Are the Pros and Cons of a Septic Tank?</h3>
          <p>
            Septic tank systems come with several pros and cons that should be
            considered before purchasing a home with one or connecting a home to
            the city’s sewer system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Pros of a septic tank system include the following:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Good for areas where accessing a sewer is too expensive or
              impossible
            </li>
            <li>Relatively cheap to install and maintain</li>
            <li>Reduced water bill, eliminated sewage costs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Cons of a septic tank system include the following:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Items that can’t be biologically broken down can never get flushed
              into the tank (hair, dental floss, grease, fat, diaper wipes,
              paper towels, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Bleach and other harsh chemicals can’t be used to clean</li>
            <li>Pumping costs required every 2-5 years</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Do All Homes Have Septic Tanks?</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the U.S. only around 20% of homes have septic tanks.
            Septic tanks are most commonly found in rural areas where there are
            large amounts of land separating neighbors.&nbsp;However, here in
            south Florida, they can be found in nearly every city. There are no
            set parameters as to define where to look for them, but they are
            typically found in lower income areas where people prefer not to
            incur the additional cost of having a city sewer.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What Should Prospective Homeowners Know about Septic Tanks before
            Buying?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>
              If you’re thinking about buying a home with a septic tank system,
              here are some things you should know first:
            </b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A septic system inspection is required before a title can be
              transferred.
            </li>
            <li>
              Septic tanks can last 40 years or longer, so know how old the tank
              is before buying
            </li>
            <li>
              You may have to replace the system at some point during your
              homeownership, which can cost upwards of $7,000 for a conventional
              system. Alternatives may cost more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find out if there’s ever been a history of the septic tank system
              failing or needing repairs
            </li>
            <li>
              Septic tanks are often buried under concrete and not maintained, A
              septic tank can only be neglected for so long before permanently
              damaging the drain field, in such a case the only solution is to
              dig up the entire yard (Approx. 2000 SF depending on number of
              bedrooms) and replace it. This is a very costly project.
            </li>
          </ul>
