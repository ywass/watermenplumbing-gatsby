            If you are getting ready to put your home on the market, it is
            almost certain that you are also thinking of doing some renovations
            to the property. While more popular upgrades like a garage door
            replacement, landscaping improvements, or repainting are certainly
            on the table, have you considered the value of upgrading your home’s
            plumbing? While the plumbing system is not the most advertised part
            of a home,&nbsp;
            <Link
              rel="nofollow"
              target="_blank"
              to="https://trusthomeproperties.com/"
            >
              TrustHomeProperties.com
            </Link>
            &nbsp;explains it can have a huge impact on the sales price.
          </p>
          <p>
            How is upgrading your home’s plumbing important to the sale of the
            property?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Plumbing fixtures in the kitchen and bathroom/toilets are a magnet
              for the buyer’s eyes. Upgrading faucets and other fixtures will
              freshen up the entire kitchen and bathroom.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plumbing makes up a considerable part of the home’s essential
              systems. If plumbing is operating efficiently, the home is more
              valuable to buyers.
            </li>
            <li>
              EPA regulations mandate sellers to disclose the presence of
              lead-based paint in a home but don’t do the same for lead pipes. A
              plumbing upgrade can help relieve buyers of this worry.
            </li>
            <li>
              With well looked after plumbing systems, buyers know they don’t
              have to worry about water damage or mold.
            </li>
            <li>
              Basically, upgrading a home’s plumbing guarantees that the home is
              highly-functional and buyers will be able to live there in maximum
              comfort.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, given the high cost of completely overhauling the home’s
            plumbing systems, which upgrades are the best ones to begin with?
            Here are some tips to help you decide.
          </p>
          <h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install pull-out faucets</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              alt="Two basin steel kitchen sink"
              src={nov20FirstTwoImg}
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Installing a pull-out faucet is not just a way to update the
            aesthetic appeal of kitchen and bathroom sinks. These
            highly-affordable upgrades are also very functional. They are
            versatile and can be operated with one hand. In the kitchen, pairing
            the faucet with a double kitchen sink will deliver the most value at
            the lowest possible cost.
          </p>
          <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace old piping</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              alt="Copper pipes"
              src={nov20FirstThreeImg}
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            If plumbing pipes are made of galvanized steel, they will be prone
            to corrosion and may pose a health risk. Lead and polybutylene pipes
            or cast iron, clay, and plastic sewer lines are also a problem.
            Water supply lines should be upgraded to copper pipes and for waste
            outlets, use PVC.
          </p>
          <h3>
            3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install low-flow or eco-friendly upgrades
          </h3>
          <p>
            These include&nbsp;
            <Link
              rel="nofollow"
              target="_blank"
              to="https://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/home-design/best-options-for-high-efficiency-toilets"
            >
              energy-efficient toilets
            </Link>
            &nbsp;that use 1.5 gallons of water per flush versus the 3.5 – 5
            gallons that older toilets use. Toilets with dual-flush function use
            even less water because they have two flushing modes for liquid and
            solid waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Installing low-flow devices to showerheads and faucets will also
            reduce the amount of water that is used without affecting the
            quality of bath times and washing.
          </p>
          <h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insulate the pipes</h3>
          <p>
            Due to their potential for energy-loss, exposed pipes contribute
            more to high energy bills than most homeowners know. This is because
            pipes and heaters are typically located in the coolest part of the
            building, the basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insulating pipes is easily and cheaply done by packing exposed pipes
            with pipe wraps and sleeves. But the effect of this minor upgrade on
            energy and maintenance cost is significant.
          </p>
          <h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drain maintenance</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              alt="water going down the drain"
              src={nov20FirstFourImg}
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Clogged and slow running drains are the most common plumbing
            problems in the home. They are often symptomatic of deeper issues
            with the plumbing. They can be the reason why a buyer walks away
            from a home. Having the drain inspected and fixing the problems will
            prevent this. Also, installing strainers and hair-blockers in sinks
            will protect the drain
          </p>
          <h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install a dishwasher</h3>
          <p>
            A dishwasher is a great convenience to have in the kitchen. Having
            one in place allows the home to capture a wider segment of potential
            buyers. Buyers who are used to having a dishwasher at home will
            appreciate the presence of the appliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who don’t have one will look forward to having one in their
            new home. An eco-friendly dishwasher is best and it will fit in with
            other eco-friendly upgrades.
          </p>
          <h3>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace the old water heater</h3>
          <p>
            <Link
              rel="nofollow"
              target="_blank"
              to="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/water-heaters/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=As%20the%20result%20of%20recently,See%20water%20heater%20types%20below.)"
            >
              Newer water heaters are more efficient
            </Link>
            . They heat faster and use less energy while making more hot water
            available. There is a range of options to choose from, depending on
            the specific needs of the home. Tankless heaters dispense of the
            need for storing water and are better at managing energy. They are
            great for homes where extra space is a luxury. Homeowners may also
            choose a gas-based or electricity-based water heater.
          </p>
          <h3>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a laundry room</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              alt="Washing machine and dryer in cabinet in laundry room with detergent jars on top"
              src={nov20FirstFiveImg}
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            A room that is solely dedicated to laundry, with washing and drying
            machines, is a big draw for potential buyers. It reduces clutter in
            the home and allows all laundry activities, including ironing, to be
            restricted to a specific part of the home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a laundry room does not require the home to have a lot of
            unused space. Washers and dryers are available as stackable units
            that do not take up a lot of room.
          </p>
          <h3>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add an extra bathroom</h3>
          <p>
            The final and, arguably, most expensive plumbing upgrade, is adding
            an extra bathroom. This can be a half-bath with a sink and toilet.
            Or it can be a luxury bathroom with expensive features. Whichever it
            is, having more than one bathroom in the home can increase its value
            by as much as 23% and make it much more attractive to buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            There you have it, plumbing tip upgrades to help you increase your
            home’s value.
