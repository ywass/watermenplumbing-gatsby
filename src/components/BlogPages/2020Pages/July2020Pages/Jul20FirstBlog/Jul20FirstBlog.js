            Plumbing is probably the most undervalued component of a home. It
            makes much of what we call modern housing possible. On-demand access
            to water or gas in the kitchen, bathroom, and toilet, is made
            possible by a home’s plumbing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sanitary conditions we enjoy is all down to the plumbing
            systems. And even if we like to forget the pipe as it works in the
            background, we never want it to malfunction. Yet plumbing failures
            are one of the most common emergencies that happen in homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many homeowners overlook the telltale signs of problems with a
            home’s plumbing. They pay attention only when the system breaks
            down, explains&nbsp;

            , and they lose access to water, gas, or sanitation. Big-budget
            repair issues in the plumbing system are avoidable; their cost in
            time, effort, money, and convenience is unnecessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            By implementing a maintenance program that tackles small emergencies
            on time, homeowners can keep their plumbing in good order, without
            spending much. To be able to do this, here are the common plumbing
            emergencies.
          </p>
          <h2>Leaks</h2>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Dripping faucet"
              width={438}
              height={224}
              className="media-left"
              src={jul20FirstTwoImg}
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaks – faucets, pipes, and toilets – are an almost constant feature
            of plumbing. Dripping faucets result from a worn-out washer or
            gasket. The problem is annoying and will increase a home’s water
            bill.&nbsp;

            >
              Yet it is effortless to solve
            </Link>
            ; dismantle the faucet and replace the worn part. Running toilets
            are not hard to fix either. They result from faulty components that
            cause a weak flush or prevent the toilet tank from filling. The most
            damaging type of leak, however, is a pipe leak.
          </p>
          <p>
            These usually occur at joints and are often hard to detect. They can
            cause severe damage to the building; mold, ceiling collapse, and
            structural damage. Regular inspection of pipes and joints for signs
            of leakage is critical.
          </p>
          <h2>Blocked Drains</h2>
          <p>
            Blockages in drain pipes manifest as sinks, tubs, and showers that
            do not allow water to escape when the drain is opened. The water
            either drains out very slowly or not at all. Hair, soap chunks,
            small objects (like toys), and lard are common culprits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way to fix the problem is to remove the cause of the blockage
            with a plunger, drain snake or drain cleaner. If the blockage
            happens in a toilet, it is because something other than human waste
            or toilet paper has been flushed down the toilet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a plunger, drain snake or drain-cleaner does not solve the
            problem, call a plumber. To avoid this problem, never flush paper
            towels, wipes or any objects down the toilets. And use a hair
            catcher in the shower.
          </p>
          <h2>Broken Water Heater</h2>
          <p>
            A broken water heater will douse you in cold water when you least
            expect it, or it will produce water that is too hot. It may also
            give off a bad odor. The two principal causes of water heater issues
            are leaks and build-up of scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bad smells, together with loss of efficiency, are mostly caused by
            the accumulation of sediments and build-up of scale in the heater.
            It can be solved by flushing and de-scaling the heater. But if water
            puddles below the heater, the problem is probably caused by a leak.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that case, shut-off gas/power to the heater, as well as its water
            supply and call a plumber.
          </p>
          <h2>Frozen Pipes</h2>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Pipe with faucet on brick wall"
              width={448}
              height={336}
              className="media-right"
              src={jul20FirstThreeImg}
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            If water freezes inside pipes, the pipes will become more prone to
            damage. Water expands when it freezes, and this can cause pipes to
            burst. Frozen pipes are regular in empty homes. But they are also
            not uncommon in occupied properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent pipes from freezing, wrap them in heater tape and
            disconnect outside water hoses in winter. And, since moving water is
            less liable to freeze, leaving a trickle of water on during winter
            will prevent freezing. If pipes still freeze over, try to thaw them
            with hot water bottles or call a plumber.
          </p>
          <h2>Sewer Backup</h2>
          <p>
            It is a severe problem, not only for its unpleasantness but for how
            damaging it can be and how expensive it is to fix.&nbsp;
            <Link
              rel="nofollow"
              target="_blank"
              to="https://homereference.net/sewer-backup/"
            >
              Warning signs that a sewer has problems
            </Link>
            &nbsp;include gurgling toilets, foul smells from the drain, and
            water pooling around the pipes in a basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is not always caused by faulty plumbing or negligence.
            It can happen when tree roots interfere with sewer lines. But the
            more common cause is flushing things down the toilet that clog the
            sewer lines. This problem is best avoided, but if it occurs, you
            should contact a plumber immediately.
          </p>
          <h2>Leaking Washing Machine Hose</h2>
          <p>
            The washing machine's hoses are flexible and delicate. They crack,
            bulge, and burst quickly. A leaking washing machine hose can cause a
            host of disasters inside a home. It is often the precursor to the
            onset of mold.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to damaging the machine, water from a leak can damage
            walls and weaken the home’s foundations. Washing machine hose leaks
            are not always easy to detect. Regular inspection is required to
            prevent this problem.
