            As a landlord, the responsibility of ensuring the property is in a
            good state of repair is solely yours. That said, from the moment
            your tenant signs the lease, the responsibility of maintaining the
            property becomes shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requirements on who is responsible for rental maintenance should
            be clearly laid out in the lease or rental agreement warns&nbsp;

            . Generally, landlords are responsible for things like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Providing the tenant with living conditions that are safe and
              habitable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing the tenant with adequate notice prior to entering the
              unit. For most states, this notice period is usually 24 or 48
              hours.
            </li>
            <li>Addressing maintenance issues in a prompt manner.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Providing personal contact information to the tenant.</li>
            <li>
              Providing the tenant with adequate notice prior to raising the
              price of rent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following the state’s eviction laws when evicting a tenant for a
              lease violation.
            </li>
            <li>Returning the tenant’s security deposit when it’s due.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tenants, on the other hand, have the following responsibilities
            under most lease agreements.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pay rent without delays.</li>
            <li>Keep the rental premises in a clean state at all times.</li>
            <li>
              Repair any damage that they have caused to the property by
              themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide the landlord with adequate notice when planning to move
              out at the end of the lease.
            </li>
            <li>Provide the landlord with access to the premises.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With that in mind, so who then is responsible for what when it comes
            to plumbing maintenance and repair in your rental property? Well, if
            this is the question you came here looking for an answer for, you’ve
            reached the right place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Before the Tenancy Begins</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <img

                src={mar20FirstOneImg}
              />
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before a tenant signs the lease, the landlord is responsible for any
            existing plumbing issues. As per the Warranty of Habitability Law,
            you must fix any safety, health, or structural issues that may exist
            before the tenant moving in.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t, you risk getting yourself in legal hot soup. So,
            before the tenant moves in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure the radiators are functioning properly.</li>
            <li>Remove any obstructions from drains and gutters.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Check for corrosion on metal pipes.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              Replace the seals on bathtubs or showers if necessary and check
              for signs of damp.
            </li>
            <li>Check for any drips or leaks on taps.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Once a Tenant Moves In</strong>
          </p>
          <p>

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When a tenant moves in, it’s your responsibility to provide them
            with all the necessary information they can use in case of an
            emergency. For instance, the plumber’s emergency number as well as
            for instructions on what to do in case of an issue.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You could even consider including a plumbing clause in your lease
            agreement. The following are some instructions you could
            include.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Monitor what you flush down the toilet. Don’t flush diapers,
              feminine hygiene products, or objects such as non-paper products
              or cotton swabs that are non-degradable.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove hair from the shower and sink drains on a regular
              basis.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link

                Clean the laundry lint filters regularly
              </Link>
              . This should include the filters in the dryer and the washer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid putting starchy foods, stringy vegetables, grease, or hard
              objects such as bones in the garbage disposal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You should also explain the potential damage to the plumbing system
            should they fail to adhere to these stipulations. You could
            communicate this verbally or just include it in a tenant information
            pack.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Responsibility for Repairs&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The responsibility for plumbing repairs after a tenant has moved in
            depends on the reason for the damage. If the damage has occurred as
            a result of the tenant’s carelessness or negligence, then the
            responsibility for repair falls squarely on them and not the
            landlord.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the damage results from normal wear and tear, then the
            landlord becomes responsible for the repairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Handling Tenant Maintenance Requests</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <img
                alt="Toilet"
                className="media-right"
                src={mar20FirstThreeImg}
              />
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Plumbing repairs fall under two categories: emergency and
            non-emergency ones. Examples of urgent repairs include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flooding</li>
            <li>Ceiling leaks</li>
            <li>Burst water mains</li>
            <li>Blocked toilets</li>
            <li>Broken water heater</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If any of these occur, acting fast is critical. This is because any
            of these may pose immediate safety or health risks to your tenants.
            Many states allow 3-7 days, while others allow a landlord up to 30
            days to fix a serious issue.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, you need to notify your tenant of your intentions to
            access their property. However, with emergency issues, the
            notification rule isn’t necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            For non-emergencies like a leaking faucet, the responsibility will
            depend on the lease agreement as well as the reason for the fault.
