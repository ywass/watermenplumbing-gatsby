            <p>
              The intensity of rain in Florida differs from states situated
              farther north. Some of these torrential downpours can cause
              significant worry and trouble for homeowners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people believe that their pipes are in great condition and
              their drainage system can handle the worst. But, as{" "}

              warns, they are caught by surprise when they discover that their
              plumbing system can’t handle the extra rain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we are going over the top plumbing issues that you should watch
              out for when it rains. You can use this article as a handy checklist
              to check for damage after a rainstorm or prevent these issues in the
              first place.
            </p>
            <h2>#1: Blocked Drains</h2>
            <figure />
            <p>
              Rainstorms bring debris along with the excess water. That’s why
              drain blockage is a common problem during bouts of heavy rain. The
              dirt, leaves, and twigs start clogging your drains after entering
              the sewer system
            </p>
            <p>
              The symptoms for this kind of blockage can be experienced in the
              form of sluggish drains that won’t get rid of the water as quickly
              as before. Sometimes the issue is accompanied by a strange smell of
              sewage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your first option is using a plunger.{" "}

                Should that fail to work
              </Link>
              , you should get in touch with a professional plumbing technician.
              Unclogging your drains may require some expert assistance.
            </p>
            <h2>#2: Basement Flooding</h2>
            <figure />
            <p>
              Heavy rains bring about flooding. When it comes to your home,
              anything located underground is at the highest flooding risk. The
              most efficient way to prevent flooding trouble is the installation
              of a sump pump.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend{" "}

                testing your sump pump
              </Link>{" "}
              before a major rainstorm arrives. This is an easy task. You just
              have to pour some water into the crock. A properly working pump will
              automatically activate and pump the poured water out.
            </p>
            <h2>#3: Damaged Pipes</h2>
            <p>
              Did you know that raining after a long drought makes it more likely
              for your pipes to crack? Every time it rains again, the likelihood
              of complete breakage increases. The pressure carries more
              detrimental effects when there are already tiny cracks in the pipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it’s true that old pipes are prone to acquire serious damages
              and fail, you should check your pipes even when they are relatively
              new. The top signs you should watch out for include low water
              pressure and brown water from your faucets.
            </p>
            <h2>#4: Septic Tank Flooding</h2>
            <p>
              Homeowners who have a septic tank on their property should be aware
              of the risk of septic flooding. This happens when a torrential
              downpour saturates your drain field. As a result, the tank can’t
              handle the situation and put out water.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a situation, drain water likely starts backing up through
              your pipes. After the first time it happens, you should immediately
              make adjustments to your septic tank system.
            </p>
            <h2>#5: Condensing Boiler Damage</h2>
            <p>
              Your condensing boiler could be another risk factor during a
              downpour. That’s because sometimes condensate pipes get installed
              improperly, effectively terminating at the rainwater downpipe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heavy rain will overfill the downpipe and the water starts to back
              up your condensate pipe. As the water travels through the pipes, it
              will eventually flood the boiler machinery. Keep in mind that a
              flooded condensing boiler is extremely likely to be beyond repair.
            </p>
            <h2>Check for Accompanying Issues</h2>
            <p>
              Heavy rain can cause additional problems in your home. We recommend
              inspecting your house for the following types of damage as well.
              Spotting these problems indicate that your home could be at a higher
              risk of rainstorm-related plumbing damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Leaky roof</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Heavy rain together with strong wind is bound to affect your roof.
              Check your roofing for water leaks after a rainstorm. Discovering
              significant damage could mean that you face plumbing issues as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Waterlogged siding</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Warping wood after heavy rain is a sign of serious concern.
              Waterlogged siding may start coming off your house. Fix damaged
              sections and make sure to treat the replacement section with
              chemicals that turn the surface waterproof.
