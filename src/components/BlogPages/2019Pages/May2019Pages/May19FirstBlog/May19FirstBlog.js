            Flint, Michigan might be miles and miles away, but Florida is
            starting to find some common ground. According to an article from
            the&nbsp;

            <strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Florida’s drinking water is among the worst
            in the country. While Flint might have us beat, we’re not far off in
            terms of water quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re a business owner or a homeowner, or both, you need to
            be more than just a little concerned about the statistics. Florida
            was ranked second when it came to unsafe drinking water. With high
            levels of toxic elements like lead, arsenic, and other chemicals,
            focusing on proper plumbing is more important now than ever.

              className="media-left"

              height={267}

          <p>
            Maybe you’re not drinking that water straight from the tap, but
            think about all the times you brush your teeth, wash your
            vegetables, do your laundry, take a shower, or bathe your kids. If
            you own a hotel or restaurant, just think about the nasty potential
            there is for contamination to your guests. It’s a huge problem for
            the state and with cuts to the EPA from the president, it doesn’t
            look like it’s going away any time soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flint, Michigan has been enduring its water woes for 5 years. When
            there’s no one enforcing the drinking water laws and the water
            infrastructures are outdated and deteriorating by the day, it
            compounds the problem. It’s only going to get worse for South
            Florida too, which is why taking care of your plumbing now can help
            keep your water clean and clear in your home and business.
          </p>
          <p>
            While utilities bear the brunt of the blame, when you have the right
            systems in place on your property, it helps keep much of the
            nastiness out. Water from the tap these days features frightening
            additives like lead, copper, cancer-causing chemicals,
            pharmaceuticals, and human waste.
