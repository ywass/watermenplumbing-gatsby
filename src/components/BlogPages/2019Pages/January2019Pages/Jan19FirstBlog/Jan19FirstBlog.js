            Where is your drinking water coming from? What kind of pipes are in
            your walls?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many different types of piping we use to supply fresh
            water to our great city homes. Before buying a house it's always a
            good idea to make sure your piping is in good condition, else look
            out for costly plumbing re-piping and hotel stays while being done.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most common piping to look out for Is called
            “polybutylene” This piping, made of plastic and grey in appearance
            is very much prone to&nbsp;

              leaking
            </Link>
            &nbsp;and is therefore no longer used. However, there were many
            houses that were pipped with polybutylene in the early ’80s before
            the flaw was found. If you find a house with this type of piping,
            you can expect a costly plumbing expense as they will need to
            be&nbsp;

            . Most insurance companies will not insure your home if these pipes
            are present.

            There are many other types of plastic piping used today, we will
            discuss the two most common amongst them used for residential, aside
            from other reasons, mostly as a cheaper alternative to copper.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first one is known as “Cpvc”, This piping slightly yellow/brown
            in appearance, is rated for hot and cold water, it is not prone to
            leaking like the polybutylene but they do get very brittle over
            time. We have been called out many times by clients who have
            accidentally cracked the pipe by simply trying to shut a valve. You
            may not have to worry about pin-hole leaks, but be mindful of your
            piping integrity if you have a home with this piping, especially if
            is an older home.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next piping is known as “PEX”, there are different types of Pex,
            the most commonly used ones are, Pex A and Pex B. Both are made from
            the same material (cross-linked polyethylene), the main differents
            lies in the way they get connected to each other. Though also made
            of plastic, this piping has been around longer than Cpvc and
            Polybutylene and has been used in Europe for at least 50 + years
            now, proving itself to be quite reliable.
          </p>
          <p>Pex A or Pex B?</p>
          <p>
            When supplying water to a home, there are many different lines,
            branches, and turns the pipes must make in order to reach their
            intended fixture. The way that this gets done is by using the
            specifically designed fitting for the pipe in use. Pex A and B are
            not interchangeable in the way they connect to other piping of the
            same material. As an example, Pex A uses plastic rings that get a
            place at the end of the piping where the joint will be, the piping
            and ring then get expanded with a special tool. once expanded there
            are just seconds for the fitting to be inserted before the piping
            takes on its original shape and seals the fitting in for good. Pex B
            is commonly connected by a similar fitting but instead of expanding
            the piping, the fitting is simply inserted and then secured with a
            ring that gets crimped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Pex A, however, these fittings reduce the diameter of the
            piping at each point as they are smaller than the internal diameter
            of the pipe. In turn, this will lower the volume of water reaching
            the fixtures. In addition, the crimp tool required for the
            attachments of the fittings generally requires regular calibration,
            which if not done, can lead to leaky joints and costly repairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Copper piping is arguably the most reliable and the shiniest, but is
            it worth the extra cost?
          </p>
          <p>
            Copper piping has a big advantage that no other piping can provide,
            the most valuable one in our opinion is its ability to kill
            bacteria. &nbsp;

          <p>
            Like many other pipes, there are different grades of copper, the
            grading of the copper will determine the wall thickness and the
            longevity of the piping. The most common ones in order of thickness
            are Types M and L, these can be identified by the color of the
            lettering on the piping; M- Red lettering, and L-Dark Blue
            lettering.

          <p>Fun fact,</p>
          <p>
            Did you know?&nbsp; The city is required to drain water lines In
            certain areas where and when the water has been sitting in the
            piping for extended periods of time due to minimal use, this is done
            to keep the water fresh and remove any harmful bacteria that may be
            growing while stagnant?&nbsp; #Waterfilter
