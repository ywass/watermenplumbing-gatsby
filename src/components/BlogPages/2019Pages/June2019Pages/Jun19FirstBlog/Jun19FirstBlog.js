          <p>DO YOU NEED A GODZILLA ANTI-SCALE SYSTEM:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Imagine if the military had a weapon that could remove the scales
            from Godzilla or any other creature of its size? This would change
            the “scales” of war, wouldn’t it? On a more realistic level….. did
            you know that in your plumbing that water ends up leaving scales
            behind from minerals that can become impenetrable too….. This system
            I’m going to discuss can remove the scales and allow water to flow
            freely and cleanly again.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img

          <p>
            Water over 7gpg is considered hard water. Over 80% of Americans live
            in hard water areas. This leaves signs of calcium and magnesium
            build-up / scaling which are clear to identify to the trained eye in
            the home. Consider a simple water heater flush, for example.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Scale forms and sticks where the temperature increases and/or the
            pressure decreases (shower heads, faucets, fixtures, appliances,
            water heaters, boilers, etc.)&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Flow-Tech Home</strong>&nbsp;stops scale by causing minerals
            to stick together, flowing through and during the drain, instead of
            sticking to the plumbing system. Only Flow-Tech works at the time,
            whether water is flowing or not because the signal travels in the
            water. (Sold exclusively through reputable service contractors and
            TESTING IS REQUIRED)&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Flow-Tech descales existing lime scale buildup through the plumbing
            system and extends useful life.

            This green product uses as much energy as a night light, lessens
            soap/detergent requirements, and has no water waste or maintenance.
            It can pay for itself in as little as a few years.

          <p>SIZING AND INSTALLATION:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The standard home unit fits up to 1.5″ pipe&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              The waterproof enclosure allows for interior or exterior
              installation
            </li>
            <li>
              Unit is installed at the water heater on the cold water line and
              jumped over to the hot water line so the signal has propagated
              both ways throughout the structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Must be plugged into a grounded outlet and tested on-site.&nbsp;

          <p>WHY IS THE COMBO THEIR BEST OPTION???&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Flow-Tech Home Anti-scale is NOT A FILTER&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Flow-Tech Filter is NOT A DESCALER&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              Flow-Tech Home Anti-Scale is not a Softener, but it does stop the
              harmful effects of scale and retains beneficial minerals in the
              water&nbsp;
