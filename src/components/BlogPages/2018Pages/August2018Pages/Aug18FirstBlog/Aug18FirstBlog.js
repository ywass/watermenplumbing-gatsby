            These are questions many of us have when hiring a plumber. So, why
            is it that every time a plumber comes to your house it seems like
            you’re spending a fortune?

            <em>
              “The&nbsp;
              <strong>society which scorns excellence in plumbing</strong>
              &nbsp;as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy
              because it is an exalted activity will have neither good&nbsp;
              <strong>plumbing</strong>&nbsp;nor good philosophy: neither its
              pipes nor its theories will hold water.” -John W. Gardner

            One could argue that plumbers save more lives than doctors, how is
            that you ask? Well, historically, most deaths that occurred in the
            world were people becoming ill from diseases spread by poor/lacking
            sanitation and plumbing as well as contaminated water supplies.

            Professional plumbers, including those in Pembroke Pines FL, are
            part of the backbone of what runs our great cities. Think, what
            would you do if you couldn’t shower, let alone take a&nbsp;

              hot shower
            </Link>
            , couldn’t wash your hands or your dishes. Not to mention your
            favorite bathroom buddies, the&nbsp;

            &nbsp;Aka Water closet, aka the John, aka porcelain throne. These
            are things we all take for granted today, but when gone tomorrow,
            would impact us greatly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plumbing, as well as other trade professionals, are jobs that are
            guaranteed to stay in our great cities and employ our youth with an
            honorable career and provide a great salary. These are jobs that
            cannot be “shipped overseas.”

            <strong>Why not hire a handyman?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sure I need someone to fix my plumbing issue, but why should I call
            someone with a business, I don’t want to have to pay for all that
            overhead, I could get a handyman to do it just as well for half the
            price”
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no shortage of disaster stories&nbsp;that have happened to
            people who hired unlicensed professionals, for even the smallest
            projects, &nbsp;but you could just youtube that and see for
            yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plumbing, though a humble activity, should not be mistaken for a job
            any handy person can do. Licensed plumbers are required to go
            through rigorous training and schooling and could take up to 7 years
            for an apprentice to achieve his License. The reason for this is
            because of the nuances involved in even the simplest of plumbing
            projects, for example, installing a simple hose spigot without the
            proper code requirements can lead to water contamination in your
            home and severe illness. There are many things a novice, handyman,
            or unlicensed professional will not know that could cause potential
            harm to your wallet and more importantly you and your family’s
            health

            <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Did you know that before toilets and outhouses people would dump
            their waste (chamber pots) in the public streets?&nbsp; In NYC 100
            people in a building would share 4 outhouses. Can you imagine
            the&nbsp;

            ? Well, now you know.

          <p>
            “Ok I get it, so plumbers are important, but that doesn’t mean they
            have to be so expensive” I mean, doctors are important too…
            (Exactly)
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of running a professional and legitimate business alone
            would make some cringe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next time you get a bill from your plumber, remember that much
            of that is going to pay for; vehicle fees and maintenance, vehicle
            fuel, stocking inventory, multiple insurances (required by law)
            workers compensation, employee salaries, accounting fees, utilities,
            office expenses, licensing fees, legal fees, tool theft. &nbsp;Aside
            from your plumber’s salary, the company he works for needs to make
            some income as well. After all, it is a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to note that while your local service
            professional is serving you and other members of our great cities,
            it takes time to get from one job to the next, realistically, there
            are only 5 or so billable hours in a day for a plumber.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this information coming to light, are plumbers too expensive?
            The real question is, how can you afford to not hire a service
            professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            As many professional plumbers will say “a lot of our business comes
            from fixing the other guys work”
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Old London UK cartoon "
              className="media-left"
              src={aug18FirstTwoImg}
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, though hiring a professional plumber may seem
            costlier, it is in fact not only the better option and will cost you
            less in the long run.&nbsp; Paying less money upfront might be the
            seemingly cheaper option but will not only will it cost more, but
            one will have to deal with the added inconvenience of calling a
            plumber back and being unable to use whatever it is that needs
            repairing. When installed and maintained correctly, most plumbing
            fixtures will last you a lifetime.
